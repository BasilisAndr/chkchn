=Synopsis=
Chukchi is a language with rich and complicated morphology and incorporation.<br />
By now morphological parsers using regular expressions were not able to handle it properly. The platforms themselves were not very user-friendly (no documentation whatsoever). <br />
HFST offers more possibilities than regular expressions for both analysing and constructing forms of Chukchi.<br />
Apertium is, on the one hand, a platform that uses HFST, and on the other hand, a community that is interested in minor languages. <br />
Chukchi is a minority language in Russia that needs a transducer-based morphological parser -- seems like a perfect match.

==Deliverables==
Anticipated result: <br />
*well-documented,
*easy to use
morphological analyser for Chukchi that handles
* nouns
* verbs
* incorporation (probably)
that occur in a collection of Chukchi texts.<br />
From the other point of view it will be a simple tool for automated glossing of Chukchi texts in Russian as meta-language.

==Benefits==
The result of this work, if I get selected, would be of great use for linguists investigating Chukchi and an important brick for building a morphologically annotated corpus of Chukchi that could be easily updated with automated glosses.<br />
It will also, of course, allow for future machine translation between Chukchi and Russian. ?

=Timeline=
==Post-application period==
Investigation time:
*get to know HFST better
* get a full picture on Chukchi morphology
*improve skills in building finite-state transducers
* make some test cases to aid further development

==Community bonding period==
* start working with nouns

==Work period==
The most salient way to set weekly goals is to set the percent of the corpus (aka the collection of texts) forms coverage, so the timeline goes roughly like this:
*'''Week 1''' 40% coverage of the corpus forms
*'''Week 2''' 55%
*'''Week 3''' 65%
*'''Week 4''' 75%
'''Milestone #1''' 75% coverage of the corpus
*'''Week 5''' 80%
*'''Week 6''' 83%
*'''Week 7''' 86%
*'''Week 8''' 90%
'''Milestone #2''' 90% coverage of the corpus
*'''Week 9''' 92%
*'''Week 10''' 94%
*'''Week 11''' 96%
*'''Week 12''' 98% coverage
The corpus is not very large, so hopefully I will be able to analyse all or almost all of the forms.

==Skills and Qualifications==
4 years of Fundamental and applied linguistics, almost completed Bachelor degree in linguistics at NRU HSE, Moscow, Russia.<br />
'''Languages:''' Russian (native), English (advanced), German (intermediate), Yiddish (intermediate), Norwegian (intermediate), French (elementary)<br />
'''Programming skills:''' Python, R, bash

==Non-GSoC summer plans==
I am going to write my bachelor thesis by mid June, so I will only be able to spend 10-15 hours per week.<br />
I am also going for a conference on 9-15 July, so I will be able to spend 15-20 hours for the project that week.<br />
Apart from that, I am going to work full-time up to 50 hours a week.
