! Present

FMT, VA, MD, MP

! Meeting agenda

* Draft the final work plan, including weekly targets

! Project objectives

* Write a finite-state morphological analyser for Chukchi that implements the verb system, including incorporation
* Get high (>90%) coverage over a medium sized text (~25-30,000 tokens incl. punctuation).

! Tasks 

[To be added to]

* Collect all available corpora in text format
* Implement nominal inflectional morphotactics
* Convert/categorise lexicon
* Add all non-inflecting words
* Implement nominal derivational morphotactics
* Implement morphophonology
* Make sure that N (<=10) sentences are fully covered per week.
* Implement the regular intransitive paradigm
* Implement copula stuff
* Implement the regular transitive paradigm
* Implement incorporation
** Basic version: (transitive verb prefixes) * noun lexicon * transitive verb suffixes, flags/constraints to allow only the "stem" to be incorporated
** Select known restrictions on incorporation and implement them
* Implement verbal derivation
* Define evaluation "deliverables" and weekly milestones
* Write a paper

! Questions

1) For the singulative, do we want to go with the lexicon/dictionary, or do we want to go with the stem ?
** FMT: If singulative is a limited-productivity, or non-productive derivation, go with the derived form in the lexicon.
** MD: There are minimal pairs, plain abs. + singul. abs.

2) Is the lexicon size likely to be big enough to cover all the forms in e.g. the folktale text ?
** FMT: Yes, it has basically all the stems in the paper dictionary.

3) Is it possible for Vasya to get all of the available machine readable corpora 
** MP: Will send the texts

4) We should choose one (20-30k word) text for using for the evaluation/annotation.
** Let's use the one we've been using

5) Is it possible to go simply with the noun classes in Michael's grammar ?

6) Github repo.

Lexicon size (in number of lexemes): 

V         2236
N         2719
A         626
ADV    592
Vbase 67
PRON 48
INTJ    32
PTCP  2



Lexicon examples:

аёпычьылгын (pl. эюпычьыт) колючка

* FMT: Does this have an absolutive that is not singulative?
пипикылгын пипикылгыт "mouse" -- "Singulative" is part of the stem. You can tell because of the i vowel. 
Otherwise it would have to be pepekylgyn

Tools

Here's my tool for converting between Cyrillic orthography and phonemic transcription:

https://github.com/evoling/chukchi-tools

This can also function as an approximate spell-checker, since typos are unlikely to be valid Chukchi.
